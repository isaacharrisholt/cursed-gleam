# Cursed Gleam

This is a repo of all the cursed Gleam code I could find scattered around the
interwebs.

Please don't try this at home.

## Curses

You can run any of the cursed modules by passing the module name as an argument to
`gleam run`, e.g.:

```bash
gleam run circular
```

The module names are listed below.

- [`circular`](./src/cursed/circular) - Circular imports - Thanks @joshi-monster!
- [`aliases`](./src/cursed/aliases) - Alias nightmares

## Contributing
